# Churn-Prediction
Customer Churn Analysis, Prediction &amp; Deployment
This repository contains a project for analyzing and predicting customer churn using machine learning and visualizations. This project aims to help businesses understand customer behaviour and identify patterns that lead to customer churn. The project is implemented in Python and uses Streamlit for the web interface.

## Project Files
1) churn.ipynb: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code for the initial exploration, data visualization, and churn prediction model building.
2) streamlit.py: The main file used to create a web app for churn prediction using Streamlit.
3) requirements.txt: The file lists all the dependencies required to run the project.

## Features
- Data Exploration & Visualization: Analyze customer churn data with features such as tenure, contract type, payment method, etc.
- Model Training: Build and train a machine learning model using scikit-learn to predict customer churn.
- Interactive Web Application: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit where users can input customer information and predict churn.

## Installation
1) Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
cd your-repo-name
2) Install the required Python Package: pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Run the Streamlit app: streamlit run streamlit.py

## Usage
### Predicting Churn
You can use the Streamlit app to predict whether a customer will churn. Input the customer data in the app interface, and the model will output a prediction and churn probability.

### Data Visualization
The Jupyter Notebook contains visualizations that help understand customer churn patterns based on factors such as tenure, contract type, etc.

### Screenshots
Include screenshots here of the Streamlit app and visualizations (optional)
